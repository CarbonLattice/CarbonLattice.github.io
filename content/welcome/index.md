## Introduction

Hi — my name is Simon Wright. I'm currently 19 years old and taking a gap year between high school and college.

I hope to attend RIT or something similar when I go to college, although at this point it’s still up for debate whether that will actually happen.

## What will this actually be about?

That’s a little hard to answer. As I’m writing this, I don’t exactly know — which is partly why I’m writing this blog in the first place, and why there are tags to make searching easier.

That said, I plan to work on a few main sections:

- **Electrical engineering**
  - Mostly about PCB design in KiCad for now, though that may expand.
  - A project (working name: *Boron*) will be my way of designing dev boards that expand on existing designs. The primary goal is to expose or improve features the microcontrollers already provide. For example: if an MCU has built-in CAN peripherals, the supporting hardware to enable that functionality will be included. If there’s a camera interface on higher-end models, a standard connector and pinout will be provided, etc.

- **Software & programming**
  - Likely a running log of the pain and progress I go through while learning programming.
  - Languages I plan to learn: C, C++, Python, and possibly Rust — with attention to embedded development and working close to hardware.
  - I also want to expand into robotics and related fields.
  - Later, I hope to contribute to open-source projects like Klipper.

- **Hardware**
  - One of the main things that drove me here is my initial fascination with 3D printing — something I still enjoy and want to expand on.
  - FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) also pushed me to learn many things; after four years working on it, I have experiences to share and hopefully teach from.

- **Self-improvement & learning**
  - This section is optional and may not exist later, but it will include things I’m actively improving.
  - Topics: spelling, grammar, sentence structure, and typing technique. (This post will likely be edited by ChatGPT — apologies in advance for the awful spelling in earlier drafts.)
  - I want to improve my typing style: right now I use a hybrid of touch-typing and hunt-and-peck, which causes many misses and pain.
  - I may also include information on workouts and exercise.

## Conclusion

I hope you learn something here — and if not, at least you enjoyed reading.

— Simon Wright
